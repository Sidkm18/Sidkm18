## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I am an active learner; I enjoy solving tough questions to challenge myself on **Codeforces** and **CodeChef**, improving my **logical** and **critical thinking**, while also sharpening my **programming skills** on **HackerRank**. I participate with my team in **CTFs** to find hidden flags, which helps me build and enhance my **pentesting** and **vulnerability assessment** skills.

I actively explore various fields of **computer science** and am finally pursuing my childhood passion for **game development** through **AR/VR**. Aside from that, I participate in **hackathons**â€”while I havenâ€™t won any yet, I continue to learn from them, identify areas for improvement, and work on them.
